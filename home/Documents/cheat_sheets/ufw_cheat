Commands will have to be run with root access or sudo

Enable the firewall:
--------------------
ufw enable

Rules:
------
ufw allow <port #> (Allows both TCP and UDP traffic - not ideal if  UDP is not necessary.)

ufw allow <port #>/[tcp/udp] (Allows only TCP or UDP traffic on <port #> according to which you specify.)

ufw allow ssh (Checks the /etc/services file on your system for the port that SSH requires and allows it. Many common services are listed in this file.)

---+ Ufw assumes you want to set the rule for incoming traffic, but you can also specify a direction.

ufw reject out ssh (Blocks outgoing ssh traffic.)

ufw status (View the rules you've created.)

ufw delete <rule> (To delete a rule simply add the word "delete" before the rule.)

Complex rules:
--------------
ufw deny proto tcp from <ip address> to any port 22 (Denies TCP traffic from <ip address> to port 22 on the local system.)

Misc commands:
--------------

ufw reset (Resets the firewall to its default state.)

ufw app list (Lists application profiles available on your local system.)

ufw app info <App name> (View information about a profile and its included rules.)

ufw allow <App name> (Allow an application profile.)

Logging:
--------

ufw logging on/off (Enable/disable logging. Disabled by default.)
